## About Me

My name is Hans Maree and I'm an electrical engineer from Eindhoven, The
Netherlands. I have a Bachelor degree in Applied Physics and a Masters degree
in Electrical Engineering.

In my spare time I work on one of my many projects (some of which are listed
below), play or listen to music or hang out with friends.

## Current projects

### Home automation system

A Home automation system currently installed in my parents bungalow. Currently
it supports 230V lamps, either non-dimmable or dimmable using phase control and
12V LED strips. Support for LED spots with a 1-10V interface will also be
added. Everything can be controlled from momentary switches installed around
the house. Eventually the system will be connected to (local) web server so it
can be controlled by a smart phone or even automatically based on time of day
and weather conditions.

Unfortunately I cannot make the project open source as of now, since the
repository also contains some data which my parents don't want to make public.
I will publish the sources as soon as I have cleaned up the repository.

### EDA component converter

Project to convert between different EDA component file formats with the
eventual goal of creating a single component library that can be used across
all EDA packages.

I will add this project to github soon.

### [EZvalue](https://github.com/snah/ezvalue)

A python library that makes it easy to create [value
objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object). The project is in
working, but I have put further development on hold until I have used it in a
few more project. This will allow me to improve the API.

# Past/Completed projects

The following are some of the many projects I have worked on in the past.

### Bitcoin order book viewer (Semi-completed)

I created a GUI for a friend that does bitcoin trading. It uses a popular
bitcoin exchange API to compose a list of open orders and live trades. Using a
clever trick we can make prediction several seconds before competing products,
providing an important advantage when trading.

To keep this advantage the source code can of course not be published.

### Quadcopter (Abandoned)

Some years ago I was working on a quadcopter with a friend. We would design
and build everything from scratch. However we abandoned the project when
we were about halfway finished due to lack of time and the large amount
for other quadcopter projects that where done around that time.

### [Vim-bulk-rename](https://github.com/snah/vim-bulk-rename) (Completed)

A shell script that allows the user to rename many files at once using the Vim
editor. Very useful for organising documents or MP3 files.
